cl-html5-parser: HTML5 parser for Common Lisp
=============================================

Abstract
--------

cl-html5-parser is a HTML5 parser for Common Lisp with the following features:

* It is a port of the Python library http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/[html5lib].
* It passes all relevant tests from html5lib.
* It is not tied to a specific DOM implementation.

Requirements
------------

* It has only been tested on SBCL.
* CL-PPCRE and FLEXI-STREAMS.

Usage
-----

Parsing
~~~~~~~

Parsing functions are in the package HTML5-PARSER.

~_f_~
*parse-html5* _source &key encoding strictp tree-builder as-xmls
              => document, errors, tree-builder-instance_

Parse an HTML document from source. Source can be a string, a pathname
or a stream. When parsing from a stream encoding detection is not
supported, encoding must be supplied via the encoding keyword
parameter.

When strictp is true, parsing stops on first error.

tree-builder is a designator for a tree-builder class used to build
the document. If not provided at default tree builder will be used.

When as-xmls is true the document will be returned as a XMLS-like list structure.

Returns tree values. The type of document depends on the tree-builder
used. Errors is a list of errors found during parsing. The format of
this list is subject to change. The last value is the
tree-builder-instance used to build the document.

~_f_~
*parse-html5-fragment* _source &key container encoding strictp tree-builder as-xmls
                       => document, errors, tree-builder-instance_

Parses a fragment of HTML. Container sets the context, defaults to
"div". If as-xmls is true the primary return value will be a list of
XMLS nodes. For det other parameters see +PARSE-HTML5+.

Example
~~~~~~~
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(html5-parser:parse-html5-fragment "Parse <i>some</i> HTML" :as-xmls t)
("Parse " ("i" NIL "some") " HTML")
NIL
#<HTML5-SIMPLE-TREE:SIMPLE-TREE-BUILDER {10084F4193}>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tree builders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parsing HTML5 is not possible without a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model[DOM]. cl-html5-parser
defines a minimal DOM interface via a set of generic functions,
including a simple default implementation. See treebuilder.lisp.

All generic functions take a tree instance as the first
parameter. This is an instance of the tree-builder class supplied to
+PARSE-HTML5+. When implementing your own tree builder you can
dispatch on this parameter. Thus it's possible to use what ever
representation you want for the document, without risk of interfering with
other tree builders.

Other
~~~~~

~_f_~
*html5-tree:tree-to-xmls* _tree node &optional include-namespace-p
			  => list_

Converts a DOM tree into a simple
http://common-lisp.net/project/xmls/[XMLS]-like list structure. This is a
convenience function as this data model is too anemic to implement as a
separate tree builder.  Tree and node are the tree-builder and document
objects returned from PARSE-HTML5.

If node is a document fragement a list of XMLS nodes a returned. In
all other cases a single XMLS node is returned.
